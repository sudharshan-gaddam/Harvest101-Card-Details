# How to Play Harvest101: Farm Deck Building

*Harvest101* is a single-player deck-building game set in a medieval farm. You start with a basic deck, build it up with over 200 unique cards, and use resources to meet weekly food goals while handling random events. Here’s how to play!

## Objective
- Build a thriving farm by growing your deck to produce enough **food** each week to meet the scenario’s requirements.
- Survive events and optimize resources (stone, wood, grain, gold, food) to win.

## Setup
1. **Starting Deck**: Begin with 10 basic cards (e.g., simple resource producers like “Wheat Field”).
2. **Market**: A row of cards is available to buy, refreshed as you progress.
3. **Resources**: Track stone, wood, grain, gold, and food—your farm’s lifeblood.
4. **Scenario**: Each world has unique goals (e.g., 10 food in 5 turns) and passive effects.

## Gameplay
### Turn Structure
1. **Draw**: Draw 5 cards from your deck. If it’s empty, shuffle your discard pile to reform it.
2. **Play Cards**: Use cards to gain resources, convert them, or trigger effects. Examples:
   - “Wheat Field”: Gain 2 grain.
   - “Bakery”: Turn 1 grain into 2 food.
3. **Buy Cards**: Spend resources (usually gold) to add new cards from the market to your discard pile.
4. **Discard**: Place all played and unplayed cards into your discard pile.
5. **End Turn**: Check progress toward the weekly food goal.

### Weekly Goals
- At the end of a set number of turns (e.g., 5), you must have produced the required food.
- Food resets each week, so plan ahead!

### Events
- Random events (e.g., drought, pests) can disrupt your farm. Use cards like “Scarecrow” to counter them or adapt your strategy.

## Winning
- Complete all weeks in a scenario to win. Some worlds have extra challenges (e.g., bonus objectives or tougher events).

## Tips
- **Balance Your Deck**: Mix food producers (e.g., “Bakery”), resource generators (e.g., “Forest Plot”), and event handlers (e.g., “Scarecrow”).
- **Combo Up**: Pair cards like “Wheat Field” + “Bakery” for steady food, or “Lumberjack” + “Forest Plot” to scale wood.
- **Keep It Lean**: A 10-15 card deck ensures you draw key cards often.
- **Adapt**: Use scenario effects (e.g., extra grain) to your advantage.
